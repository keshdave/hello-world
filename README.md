Hello my name is Keshavi Dave and I am currently an MSDS 1st year student at MSU. 
I graduated with my Bachelors in Statistics from Western Michigan University, where I also had 3 minors: Mathematics, Business Analytics, and Computer Science.
During my time at WMU I was also apart of the marching band (I played sousaphone!) for all 4 years and had the oppertinity to play at both Spartan Stadium and the Big House, as well as 2 bowl games during my Freshman (Quicklane Bowl in Detroit) and my Senior (Veterans bowl in Alabama) year.
I'm exited to hone my skils here at MSU and to hopefullt join the sports analytics club on campus as well. Although this is all very new to me I hope to make the best out of the next 2 years here in East Lansing :)
